# Student-performance-forecasting-using-ML


DATASET:
 we have taken four internal assessment scores of all the students in all the batches. 	We had 3 batches, 10 sections per batch, 60 students per section, and 10 instructors per batch.  It provides 3 different assessments,30 instructors' experiences on 1800 students' performances for the python course in VCET. Few students were absent for internal assessment and those absentees rows were completely removed from the analysis. After the removal of absentees, the total records become 1752. All the assessment scores are between 0 and 100. 
 
 CODE:
   Our proposed model is about predicting the final exam result of a student based on the previous exam scores. We use linear classifiers and decision tree classifiers for getting the highest accuracy. SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier are also can be used for implementing accurately.
  
In linear classifiers, we have opted to use linear discriminant analysis and SVM(Support Vector Machine) to get high prediction rates.
In decision tree classifiers, we have opted to use simple, medium and complex tree algorithms.
